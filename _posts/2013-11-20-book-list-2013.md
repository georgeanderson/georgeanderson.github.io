Another busy year with less book reading than I would like. For non-technical books, this has been the year I made the switch to digital. I'm a big fan and an old user of Kobo, but this has been only for free books. I never had such an easy digital purchase experience as with Play Books from Google. This made me give up the nice Kobo interface in favor of Play Books simplicity. My highlights for the year:

* Na Jornada com Cristo, by Max Lucado
* Cross Roads, by William P. Young
* **The Servant, by James C. Hunter**
* O SÃ©samo, by Miguel Torga
* Miura, by Miguel Torga
* **Clean Code, by Robert C. Martin**

The Servant and Clean Code were the best reads so far. In the momment my reading list includes:

* Daily Rituals, by Mason Correy
* Programming Perls, by Jon Bentley
* OCA Java SE 7 Programmer I Certification Guide-1ZO-803 exam, by Mala Gupta

To Read list has 36 titles, mostly technical. I keep them at [Amazon.] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/OF4796DOO3RA/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go_o?)
