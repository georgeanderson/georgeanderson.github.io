If you have Netflix, you should watch their TED talk bundle about Life Hacks. The one I liked most is from Jane McGonigal: The game that can give you 10 extra years of life. She put gaming in a totally different and unexpected perspective. This is worth sharing to show some people games are not necessarily evil.

Enjoy!
