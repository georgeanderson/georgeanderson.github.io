I have read [Daily Rituals](http://www.amazon.com/Daily-Rituals-How-Artists-Work/dp/0307273601/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1389168912&sr=1-1&keywords=daily+rituals) and recommend to anyone interested in knowing how great people used to manage their time and get [deep work](http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/11/21/knowledge-workers-are-bad-at-working-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it/) done.

The reason I bought this book was that I wanted to do an experiment with myself and change my own routine to see how it would give me any advantages compared to my current chaotic routine. I used to wake up at 8 in the morning, with my 18-month-old kid throwing objects out of his crib in the floor. We have breakfast together and I get to the office by 9:30 or 10. After 8.8 working hours I'm back home and have dinner with my family, play with my kid until 20:30 when we set for a bath and we put him on to sleep. After some home chores I would be ready for enjoying my hobbies by 22:00 or so. Considering I wouldn't sleep until 1 or 2, there's plenty of time to 'enjoy'.

I have done this routine above almost my entire adult life, and it hasn't dramatically changed after I became a parent. Talking to friends I realized they have a very similar routine. We all seem to share the order we do things: wake up, work, social life or hobby, sleep. Since I'm not that social these days, to me my hobbies would be the vary last thing I would do in a given day.

Writing code, even as a hobby, is a high demanding mental activity to me. If my energy levels are low, I cannot clearly think about solutions and the quality of my code is directly impacted. I often see myself stuck in problems I would rather solve quickly if they were presented during the day, when I still have brain stamina. I would inevitably take these frustrations to bed and find myself fighting sleep for hours with my brain working on background mode trying to come up with a solution to my problems. I noticed a lot of my friends also report that same sleeping problem too.

What if I changed the order of my daily events? What if instead of doing what I like to do as the very last thing in my day I did it at first? I was determined to see how that would end up and completely re-arranged my routine. Then I started to wake up at 5am sharp everyday. Now I have almost 3 hours every morning where I can work uninterruptedly, with my thoughts clear and great energy levels after drinking a cup of green tea. The order I do things now shifted to: wake up, hobbies, work, perhaps some socialization and then sleep. This shift has indeed made a deep change in the way I get things done outside work. Before this, I would get things done outside work just eventually, when there was nothing else pending - very seldom after you become a parent. Now I do get things done everyday, because I have them prioritized in front of me every morning. It's a nice feeling to see other things getting traction, things I longed to do but didn't have 'time'. Turns out my demands are still the same at work and at home, the only difference is how I organize may day. It made a big difference!
