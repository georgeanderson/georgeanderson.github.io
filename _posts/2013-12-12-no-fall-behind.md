When I first saw the famous Ruby on Rails demo by David Heinemeier back in 2005, I was doing J2EE development for a Germany ERP company. Back in there Java was the most cool thing for the present and the future in my own world. My first reaction to RoR was: WOW! That is really cool. But then none of my friends really cared about it, and the senior people I used to work with were completely skeptical. "You can do the same thing in Java" and "This is not for serious business" were what I heard most. I didn't know in who to believe honestly.

Time passed by and turns out that David and Rails folks were right. Rails became prevalent in almost every start-up project for the web since then. Ruby has grown bigger than Rails and now we have Rubists rocking the world with awesome new ways to implement OO concepts. Ruby and Rails were not vaporware, in fact Ruby community is the most impressive open source community since Linux in my opinion. These guys have not just created a framework, they started a movement. I movement where contribution and collaboration comes first - hello github.

Nevertheless the gurus of my time, the Java folks, were right as well. Ruby, Rails or any other ripster framework cannot beat Java. Java is still there and will be for a long time. How can people say Java is dead if I still see people hiring Cobol and Unibasic developers? Java will definitely die some day, but not before Cobol I'm sure.

What have I learned with this? Next time you see a movement starting, don't be skeptical. Give some respect to the new generations. Even better, engage in the movement and don't fall behind. Should I have embraced RoR back in 2005 I would have at least twice as much opportunities as I have today.

Perhaps there is a movement starting right there and I'm a little late already. "You can do the same thing in Java" and "This is not for serious business" are still what I hear from inside. In 5 years perhaps I will find both groups were right again and life will go on. The point is: will I have increased my opportunities or not? Do I want to end like that Cobol guy trying to fix beyond repair software, or do I want to follow through the shine and new? 

Only time will tell how I will end up, but this week I started to re-learn JavaScript with nodejs.
