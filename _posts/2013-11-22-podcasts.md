I think the first time I heard a podcast was around 2006 but only in 2009 I became a regular listener after I bought my first and only iPod (Nano 5th generation). Before the iPod the podcast experience to hear from my computer did not appeal to me. I want to hear and learn something even when I'm not in front of a computer, like in bed fighting against insomnia. I had an mp3 player before that I tried to use but I could not pause and resume podcasts, making it very annoying to find exactly where I stopped. My podcast list has changed through the years and currently it looks like below.

* **Nerdcast, by Jovem Nerd**
* Floss Weekly, by twit
* The Java Spotlight Podcast, by Roger Brinkley
* This Developer's Life, by Rob Conery and Scott Hanselman
* Software Engineering Radio - The Podcast for Professional Software Developers, by SE-Radio
* Southeast Christian Church, by Southeast Christian Church
* Southland Weekend Message Series, by Southland Christian Church

I still have my iPod in a drawer that will eventually be used for work out and running. Now I use my phone to listen podcasts and after using a free app from google for many years I have bought PocketCasts which is worth every penny.
