Wading through my YouTube watch list I recently stumbled on this very nice Ruby Conference lecture about code refactoring. This is very informative and impressive as you watch Ben Orenstein walk through code using vIM in light speed. The lecture is also an exemple of what I consider an almost perfect presentation where there is a nice balance between concepts and practice.
