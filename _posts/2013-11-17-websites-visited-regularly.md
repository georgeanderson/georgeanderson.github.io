I have this routine in place for many years now and I don't really know when it started or how. Every week I access this fixed list of websites, one for each week day. The one per day restriction is there to avoid procrastination, however it is not religiously followed.

**Monday**

- [BR-Linux](http://br-linux.org) - Linux related news.

**Tuesday**

- [BR-Mac](http://br-mac.org) - Pro tips for Mac users.

**Wednesday**

- [Efetividade.net](http://efetividade.net) - Effectiveness tips.

**Thursday**

- [Meio Bit](http://meiobit.com) - Science & Technology news.

**Friday**

- [Jovem Nerd](http://jovemnerd.com) - Nerd related stuff. I'm a regular listener to their podcast for a number of years now.

When my procrastination appetite is not satisfied I then redirect my browser to [DZone](http://dzone.com) and try to learn something out of my idleness.
