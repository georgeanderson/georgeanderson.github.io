I went to the movies recently to watch Gravity and saw the new trailler of Hobbit\: The Desolation of Smaug. The date is coming and we are planning to watch it in the only iMax theater in town. It will be tough to get tickets in the first two weeks though. 

Unfortunately my 17 months son is too old to wath it with us. I hope epics like LOTR and Hobbit can still be epics for him.
