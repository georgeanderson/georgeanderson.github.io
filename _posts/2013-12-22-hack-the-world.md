Anybody can learn to code. That's the motto of code.org. They have this amazing infographic showing the gap of Computer Science compared to other math and science disciplines among other interesting facts. [http://code.org/stats] (http://code.org/stats)

I recently watched [Hackers](http://code.org/stats), the movie from 1995. The first time I watched I was still in high school. I had a good inclination to CS back there, but this film certainly helped to boost that. Watching it now, I don't even think it's a good movie. There is not any resemblance of reality on being a real programmer or "hacker" in it. But when I see it from my juvenile perspective, I can see the magic it does. Hackers doesn't show one single line of code in the movie, it doesn't show one single real command line in their fake terminals, yet it shows what you can do with a computer and that is pretty amazing. Apart from the fictional aspect of it, we can really do amazing things with a computer, and the main enabler of it is coding.

I believe we need more movies like that in the theaters to inspire future generations. Showing the reality of a real programmer sitting all day in front of a computer looking through endless lines of codes would perhaps have scared me away, being a Hackers hacker is much more cool.
