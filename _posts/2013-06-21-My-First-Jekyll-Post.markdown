This is my first post using Jekyll. I intend to use GitHub to host my personal website. I
had it previously hosted at Tumblr with only two posts in two years. I would expect more
willingness to write now that I can do it completely from my favorite text editor or from 
the command line directly without having to deal with HTML formatting. Another nice thing
about hosting in GitHub is that my repository and website sit together in the same place.

In the first version it should just plain Jekyll defaults with no social interaction. The
idea is to gradually add common blog functionalities like comments (I hope there is a
disqus plugin out there), twitter, LinkedIn, PSN and others - no Facebook please.

Let's see how this works in the coming weeks. That's it for now.

Thanks,
George.
