In the year of 2000 I was introduced to this Progressive Rock band called Dream Theater (DT). This event has radically changed my music preferences for ever. I always liked Classic music (took music theory and piano classes for 1 year) but also enjoyed the distorted sound of an electric guitar. DT is the most pleasant combination of my two favorite styles: Classic music and Rock. I have a physical CD of almost every album and alternative material they produce:

* Images and Words, 1992
* When Dream And Day Unite, 1989
* Live at The Marquee, 1993 (digital from Google Music store)
* Awake, 1994
* A Change of Seasons, 1995
* Falling Into Infinity, 1997
* **Scenes From a Memory, 1999** (first album I heard)
* Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, 2002 (two CDs)
* Train of Thought, 2003
* Octavarium, 2005
* Systematic Chaos, 2007
* Black Clouds and Silver Linings, 2009
* A Dramatic Turn of Events, 2011
* _Dream Theater_ (don't have yet)

I still have many DVDs and CDs from their side projects. They are the single most listened band on my players and since they don't show any sign of slowing down, they will keep playing on my ears for a long time.
