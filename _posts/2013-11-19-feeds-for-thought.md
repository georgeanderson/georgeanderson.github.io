The death of Google Reader was not able to pull me away from RSS feeds. I had switched to Feedly even before Google announced the intentions to shutdown Reader. I'm very picky with the feeds I subscribe so I'm not overwhelmed with items I will never be able to consume. I highlight a couple of them below.

* [Study Hacks](http://calnewport.com/): Student advice that can be applied in any area of your life
* [A Neurocientista de Plant√£o](http://www.suzanaherculanohouzel.com/journal/): Brazilian neuroscientist Suzanna Herculano's blog
* [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/): Setup from people working with technology (mostly)
* [Snail In A Turtleneck](http://www.kchodorow.com/blog): MongoDB developer, writer and googler Kristina Chodorow's blog
* [Lambda The Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/): THE Programming Language Weblog
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/): Insanely busy feed for geeks

I'm constantly and carefully adding new feeds that match my current interests and removing the obsolete ones.
